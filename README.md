0) adapt paths in settings/*.yaml to your own architecture
1) launch scripts/main.py for every yaml file in settings (should take 2 to 3 days)
2) up to 1 Tbytes will be written (not really optimized but could no go much lower imo)
4) plots are produced in analysis by either notebooks or python code and save in output (hopefully)
5) launching code in analysis/ will populate the same directory than launching main with the final data to plot
   and I should add mine in some way somwehere so that you don't have to launch the main.py, but anyway if you need to play around
   with the data you should still do so. just contact me !
